What is Python?

High-level language: Focuses on human-readable code rather than machine-level details.

Interpreted: Code runs directly without compilation, making development faster.

General-purpose: Can be used for web apps, data analysis, machine learning, automation, and more.

Multi-paradigm support: Works with procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming styles

 Brief History of Python
Late 1980s: Developed by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands.

1991: First official release of Python.

2000 (Python 2.0): Introduced features like list comprehensions and garbage collection.

2008 (Python 3.0): Major update with improved consistency, though not backward compatible with Python 2

Today: Python is one of the most popular programming languages globally, powering platforms like YouTube, Instagram, Spotify, Dropbox, Netflix, and Google

Advantages of Python:

1.Readable and Understandable
Python uses a clean and simple syntax that closely resembles natural language, making it easy to read and write.

2.Minimal Boilerplate Code
Compared to languages like Java or C++, Python requires fewer lines of code to accomplish the same task, reducing complexity.

3.Cross-Platform Compatibility
Python runs on multiple platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux) without major changes to the code.

4.Extensive Standard Library
Comes with a rich set of built-in modules for tasks like file handling, networking, and data processing.

5.Large Ecosystem of Packages
Thousands of third-party libraries (e.g., NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow) for specialized tasks like data science, AI, and web development.

6.Dynamic Typing
No need to declare variable types explicitly, which speeds up development.

7.Interpreted Language
No compilation step; you can run code immediately, which is great for rapid prototyping.

8.Strong Community Support
Huge global community, extensive documentation, and active forums for troubleshooting and learning.

9.Versatile
Suitable for web development, data analysis, machine learning, automation, scripting, and more.

10.Integration Capabilities
Easily integrates with other languages (C, C++, Java) and technologies.
